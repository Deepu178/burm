# How to contribute
I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

If you haven't already, come find us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/9GzPSkJNsS). We have dedicated channels there for Burm development. 

## Testing
Code testing for burm works by creating test files, as defined in the Bun documentation. If you need help creating test files, chances are that they already exist in this project.

## Submitting changes
Please send a GitHub Pull Request to fairfield-programming with a clear list of what you've done (read more about pull requests). We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions
Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We follow the [Airbnb Javascript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) as a model for how our code should look. We also want our code to be as-fast-as-possible, so please code in the most performant ways you can imagine. 

## Afterword
There's nothing else to really say- thank you for helping contribute to this project. Your help is beyond amazing!
